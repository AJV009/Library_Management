# Library-Management-System
A fully functional Web application created in PHP.
Use lms3.sql to create the exact database and table which LMS uses.
And the software prerequisite is just XAMPP.
Due to time contraints, further development is stoped!

## Install!
- git clone https://github.com/AJV009/Library_Management.git
- Install XAMPP server stack
- Open phpmyadmin and create a database named lms
- Select import then select the file lm3.sql from the cloned repo. This will create all the tables and stuff!
- Place this Library_Management folder into htdocs folder in xampp directory
- Now go to localhost/library_management in your browser
- ALL DONE! Good to go!
